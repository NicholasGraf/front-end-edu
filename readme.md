# Frameworkless Web Application Tutorial

This repository contains a starting point for a simple frameworkless front-end SPA solution that we will develop together.

The codebase includes:

- A node server
- An index HTML page for application entry
- A CSS file for styles
- A Modular JavaScript entry file that will power our Frameworkless Application

## Run

A basic Node.js server for local development is included but not necessary.

You can simply open the application in any browser - but this node server simulates a real web server customized for an SPA.

Running this command in the CLI in this root folder of this project will load the web application in a browser for you at port 8000.

```bash
node server.js
```
